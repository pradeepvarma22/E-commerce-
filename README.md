## Algorithm
### Collabortive Filtering (Recommender Algorithm)
	- Collaborative filtering filters information by using the interactions and data collected by the system from other users.
	- There are two types of collaborative filtering
		  User-based, which measures the similarity between target users and other users.
		  Item-based, which measures the similarity between the items that target users rate or interact with and other items.


I have used user based collaborative filtering.
